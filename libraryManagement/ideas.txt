First of all there will be books in the library. So, there will be a book class
	-book_id
	-book_name
	-author_name
	-publication
	-genre
	-number_of_copies
	
Then comes actors in the system
	Staff - Librarian,admin
	Users 
	
library can be for studying there and also borrowing books.
There has to be some seating capacity also into the library. So, maybe we can make a library class also.
library class
A library can have walk in arrangements and it can have some members sections also
When a user comes in the library, the librarian will extract user info and see if he/she is a member or not
There can be a condition that a user can only borrow one book at a time
Do we have to provide some kind of system for users also where they can see which book is available in the library?


requirements 
	-verb -> things actor will do
	-noun -> component of our system
actor based on requirements
components based on actor

Search books 
can be multiple components
send notification when due date has come or book is available
